🤖 Transformer NLP Tasks
Welcome to the Transformer NLP Tasks repository — a Python-based project that showcases the powerful capabilities of transformer models in Natural Language Processing (NLP). This project leverages pre-trained models from Hugging Face Transformers to perform a range of advanced language understanding and generation tasks, and it is perfect for both learners and professionals looking to explore modern NLP solutions.

🚀 Key Features
This project includes implementations of the following tasks:
📚 Text Classification: Categorize input text into predefined classes (e.g., spam detection, sentiment analysis).
✍️ Text Generation: Generate human-like text based on a prompt using models like GPT-2 or T5.
🧠 Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identify and classify entities in text such as names, locations, and organizations.
❓ Question Answering: Extract answers to questions based on a context passage using models like BERT or RoBERTa.
📝 Summarization: Condense large texts into short summaries using abstractive techniques.
💬 Interactive Chatbot: A conversational chatbot powered by a transformer model capable of generating dynamic, human-like responses.
🖼️ Image-Based Question Answering: Upload an image and ask questions about its content — powered by vision-language models (e.g., BLIP, Donut, or ViLT).

🧰 Tech Stack
Language: Python
Libraries:
Hugging Face Transformers 🤗
PyTorch or TensorFlow (user preference)
Hugging Face Datasets
Gradio or Streamlit (for UI and chatbot demos)
PIL/OpenCV (for image handling)

Environment:
Jupyter Notebooks
Google Colab (for ease of use and GPU access)

🎯 Use Cases
This repository can be applied in real-world domains such as:
🤖 Conversational AI and chatbot systems
📰 Automatic summarization of news articles, research papers, and reports
📄 Extracting structured information from unstructured text (NER)
💬 Intelligent document-based Q&A bots
🧾 Automating customer support with text classification and response generation
🖼️ Answering questions from visual content (great for education and accessibility tools)

🔧 How to Use
Clone the repository and explore notebooks or launch them on Google Colab. Each notebook is modular and self-contained, making it easy to test different models and tasks. You can:
